### Hi there, ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Marshall Peng**. I recently graduated from Dartmouth College '20 with a Bachelors in computer science and economics, as well as a minor in statistics. I'm currently a Software Development Engineer at Amazon. Prior to this, I was a software engineering intern at Apple for a couple terms. Outside of work and school, I enjoy running, playing various musical instruments, and playing badminton. 

My interests and experiences lie mainly in AI/machine learning, virtual reality, and full stack development. If you have exciting opportunities relating to these topics, feel free to reach out as I'd love to learn more!

While you're here, please feel free to check out some of my projects
